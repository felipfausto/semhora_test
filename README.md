# EventSys
That's a test that I made in a hurry to deliver to "Sem Hora" company. It's not  beautiful but I'll keep working on it :)

## What do I need to run?

I've put a docker file in this project with nginx and MySQL. But, if you prefer you can run on an Apache server. The requirements is bellow:

1. PHP =< 5.6
2. MySQL =< 5.8
3. Composer
4. gulp
5. bower

## So, let's start!

First of all rum the command ```composer install``` on root directory. Then you can access ```/public``` and run the commands
```npm install``` and ```gulp```.

It should work now without any problem.

### What now?

Now you have to import the ```sql``` file into your MySQL. There's an user called 'Administrador' in this database. To access the admin panel use the login ```admin``` and the password ```admin```.
